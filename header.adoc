== Introduction

Zilsp is an RV32-only extension, which adds load and store instructions using register pairs. I does so by reusing existing instruction encodings which are RV64-only.

Load and store instructions will use the same definition of even-odd pairs as layed out in Zdinx.

The extension improves static code density, by replacing two separate load or store instructions with a single one. In addition, it can provide a performance improvement for implementations that can make use of a wider than XLEN memory interface.
