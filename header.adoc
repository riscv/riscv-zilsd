== Introduction

This specification contains two RV32-only extensions, which add load and store instructions using register pairs. It does so by reusing existing instruction encodings which are RV64-only. 
The specification defines 32-bit encodings (Zilsd extension) and 16-bit encodings (Zcmlsd).

Load and store instructions will use the same definition of even-odd pairs as layed out in Zdinx.

The extension improves static code density, by replacing two separate load or store instructions with a single one. In addition, it can provide a performance improvement for implementations that can make use of a wider than XLEN memory interface.
